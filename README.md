# 📊 Amazon Product Review Analysis

## 🏢 Project Overview

As part of a case study with **RetailTech Insights**, I took on the role of a Junior Data Analyst to analyze Amazon product review data. The goal was to extract actionable insights to guide **product improvement**, **marketing strategies**, and **customer engagement**.

## 📦 Given Dataset Summary Contained

- **Source**: Scraped from Amazon product pages
- **Total Records**: 1,465 products
- **Columns**: 16
- **Key Fields**:

  - Customer interaction: `review_count`, `review_title`, `review_content`

Each row represents a unique product with aggregated customer feedback.

## 📈 Analysis Tasks

Using Excel (PivotTables, formulas, and charts), I answered 14 core business questions:

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × review_count) by category?
10. How many unique products exist per price bucket? (`< $1000`, `$1000 – $5000`, `> $5000`)
11. What is the relationship between rating and discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have the highest product discounts?
14. Top 5 products based on combined ratings and review count.

- Top-rated products with highest reviews
- Heat maps showing discount and rating correlations
- Revenue opportunities by category

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Categories like **Electronics** and **Home & Kitchen** showed higher discounts and review volumes.
- Top-rated products tend to generate higher review counts and engagement.
- Discount level does not directly guarantee higher ratings.
- Products between $1000 – $5000 dominate listings and engagement metrics.
